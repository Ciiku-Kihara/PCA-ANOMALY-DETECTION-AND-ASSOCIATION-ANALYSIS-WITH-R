# PCA-ANOMALY-DETECTION-AND-ASSOCIATION-ANALYSIS-WITH-R
This repository contains 3 notebooks which contain my approach to performing PCA, anomaly detection, feature selection and association analysis for my personal project.

## Description
For this project, I am assuming that I am a Data Scientist for a supermarket in Kenya who is currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). The project has been divided into four parts where I am to explore a number of marketing datasets by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on my insights. These techiques include PCA, association analysis, feature selection and anomaly detection. My step by step analysis, insights and recommendations can all be found in the notebooks.

## Experimental design
- Problem Definition
- Check the Data
- Perform Data Cleaning
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate)
- Implement the Solutions using the 4 unsupervised learning techniques
- Provide recommendations based on my insights


## Setup Instructions
To make changes to my code, you can go ahead and fork my work.
